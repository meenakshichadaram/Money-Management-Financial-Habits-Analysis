# Money-Management-Financial-Habits-Analysis
A data analytics and machine learning project analyzing real-world money management and financial habits using self-collected survey data. Includes EDA, classification models, clustering, and PCA-based visualization.


## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing real-world financial behaviors related to money management, budgeting, savings, and financial stress using data analytics and machine learning techniques.

The dataset used in this project was **personally collected** through a Google Form survey titled  
**“Money Management & Financial Habits Analysis”**, targeting **students and working professionals aged between 18 and 45 years**.

The objective of this project is not only prediction, but also **understanding human financial decision-making** through structured analysis, visualization, and machine learning models.
